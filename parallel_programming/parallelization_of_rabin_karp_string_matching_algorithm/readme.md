## Objective

The objective of this application is to enhance the efficiency of the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm for searching patterns in large files. Traditional methods of pattern matching are time-consuming, computation-intensive, and memory-hungry. The Rabin-Karp algorithm improves search efficiency by comparing hash values instead of directly comparing the pattern string with every position of the text, utilizing a rolling hash calculation to reduce computation time. However, for real-time and online applications that need to process strings as they are received, the serial implementation of Rabin-Karp is impractical.

To address this challenge, we aim to increase the algorithm's efficiency using parallel techniques. By leveraging OpenMP for multicore shared memory architectures and MPI for distributed memory systems, we have developed a hybrid parallel program that achieves 40 times faster search capabilities compared to the serial implementation of the Rabin-Karp algorithm. This is accomplished using a specially designed split method named overlap-split, which allows the Rabin-Karp algorithm to be applied in parallel, significantly improving performance for large-scale data processing tasks.
